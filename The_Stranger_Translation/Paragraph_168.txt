But suddenly he raised his head and looked straight
at me. "Why have you refused to see me?" he asked. I
said that I didn't believe in God. He wanted to know if
I was sure and I said that I didn't see any reason to ask
myself that question : it seemed unimportant. He then
leaned back against the wall, hands Bat on his thighs.
Almost as if .it wasn't me he was talking to, he remarked
that sometimes we think we're sure when in fact we're
not. I didn't say anything. He looked at me and asked,
"What do you think?" I said it was possible. In any
case, I may not have been sure about what really did
interest me, but I was absolutely sure about what didn't.
And it just so happened that what he was talking about
didn't interest me.
