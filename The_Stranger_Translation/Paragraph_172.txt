Then he lowered his head and sat back down. He
told me that he pitied me. He thought it was more than
a man could bear. I didn't feel anything except that he
was beginning to annoy me. Then I turned away and
went and stood under the skylight. I leaned my shoulder
against the wall. Without really following what he
was saying, I heard him start asking me questions
again. He was talking in an agitated, urgent voice. I
could see that he was genuinely upset, so I listened
more closely.
