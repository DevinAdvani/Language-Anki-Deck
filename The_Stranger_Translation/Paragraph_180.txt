Then, I don't know why, but something inside me
snapped. I started yelling at the top of my lungs, and I
insulted him and told him not to waste his prayers on me.
I grabbed him by the collar of his cassock. I was pour
ing out on him everything that was in my heart, cries of
anger and cries of joy. He seemed so certain about every
thing, didn't he? And yet none of his certainties was
worth one hair of a woman's head. He wasn't even sure
he was alive, because he was living like a dead man.
Whereas it looked as if I was the one who'd come
up emptyhanded. But I was sure about me, about
everything, surer than he could ever be, sure of my life
and sure of the death I had waiting for me. Yes, that
was all I had . But at least I had as much of a hold on
it as it had on me . I had been right, I was still right, I was
always right. I had lived my life one way and I could
just as well have lived it another. I had done this and I
hadn't done that. I hadn't done this thing but I had done
another. And so? It was as if I had waited all this time
for this moment and for the first light of this dawn to
be vindicated. Nothing, nothing mattered , and I knew
why. So did he. Throughout the whole absurd life I'd
lived, a dark wind had been rising toward me from
somewhere deep in my future, across years that were
still to come, and as it passed, this wind leveled whatever
was offered to me at the time, in years no more real than
the ones I was living. What did other people's deaths
or a mother's love matter to me; what did his God or the
lives people choose or the fate they think they elect
matter to me when we're all elected by the same fate,
me and billions of privileged people like him who also
called themselves my brothers? Couldn't he see, couldn't
he see that? Everybody was privileged. There were only
privileged people. The others would all be condemned
one day. And he would be condemned, too. What would
it matter if he were accused of murder and then executed
because he didn't cry at his mother's funeral? Sala
mano's dog was worth just as much as his wife. The
little robot woman was just as guilty as the Parisian
woman M asson married, or as Marie, who had wanted
me to marry her. What did it matter that Raymond was
as much my friend as Celeste, who was worth a lot more
than him? What did it matter that Marie now offered
her lips to a new Meursault? Couldn't he, couldn't this
condemned man see . . . And that from somewhere deep
in my future . . . All the shouting had me gasping for
air. But they were already tearing the chaplain from my
grip and the guards were threatening me. He calmed
them, though, and looked at me for a moment without
saying anything. His eyes were full of tears. Then he
turned and disappeared.
