The chaplain looked at me with a kind of sadness. I
now had my back flat against the wall, and light was
streaming over my forehead. He muttered a few words
I didn't catch and abruptly asked if he could embrace
me. "No," I said. He turned and walked over to the wall
and slowly ran his hand over it. "Do you really love this
earth as much as all that?" he murmured. I didn't
answer.
