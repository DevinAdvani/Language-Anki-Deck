He stood there with his back to me for quite a long
time. His presence was grating and oppressive. I was
just about to tell him to go, to leave me alone, when all
of a sudden, turning toward me, he burst out, "No, I
refuse to believe you! I know that at one time or another
you've wished for another life." I said of course I had,
but it didn't mean any more than wishing to be rich,
to be able to swim faster, or to have a more nicely shaped
mouth. It was all the same. But he stopped me and
wanted to know how I pictured this other life. Then I
shouted at him, "One where I could remember this
life!" and that's when I told him I'd had enough . He
wanted to talk to me about God again, but I went up
to him and made one last attempt to explain to him that
I had only a little time left and I didn't want to waste
it on God. He tried to change the subject by asking
me why I was calling him "monsieur" and not "father."
That got me mad, and I told him he wasn't my father;
he wasn't even on my side.
