This perked me up a li ttle . I said I had been looking
at the stones in these walls for months. There wasn't
anything or anyone in the world I knew better. M aybe
at one time, way back, I had searched for a face in them.
But the face I was looking for was as bright as the sun
and the flame of desire-and it belonged to Marie. I had
searched for it in vain. Now it was all over. And in any
case, I 'd never seen anything emerge from any sweat
ing stones.
