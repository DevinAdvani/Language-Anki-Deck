but then sat forward and smoothed out the folds of his
cassock. When he had finished he started in again, ad

he agreed . "But if you don't die today, you'll die to
morrow, or the next day. And then the same question
will arise. How will you face that terrifying ordeal?" I
said I would face it exactly as I was facing it now.
