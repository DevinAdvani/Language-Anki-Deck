He was alone.
Il était seul.

He was lying on his back, with his hands behind his head, his forehead in the shade of the rock, the rest of his body in the sun.
Il reposait sur le dos, les mains sous la nuque, le front dans les ombres du rocher, tout le corps au soleil. 

His blue overalls seemed to be steaming in the heat.
Son bleu de chauffe fumait dans la chaleur. 

I was a little surprised.
J'ai été un peu surpris.

As far as I was concerned, the whole thing was over, and I'd gone there without even thinking about it.
Pour moi, c'était une histoire finie et j'étais venu là sans y penser.
