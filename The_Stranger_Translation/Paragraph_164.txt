Then and only then would I have the right, so to
speak-would I give myself permission , as it were-to
consider the alternative hypothesis : I was pardoned. The
trouble was that I would somehow have to cool the hot
blood that would suddenly surge through my body and
sting my eyes with a delirious joy. It would take all my
strength to quiet my heart, to be rational. In order to
make my resignation to the first hypothesis more plau
sible, I had to be level-headed about this one as well.
If I succeeded, I gained an hour of calm. That was
something anyway.
