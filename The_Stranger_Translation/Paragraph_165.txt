It was at one such moment that I once again refused
to see the chaplain . I was lying down, and I could tell
from the golden glow in the sky that evening was
coming on. I had just denied my appeal and I could
feel the steady pulse of my blood circulating inside me.
I didn't need to see the chaplain. For the first time in
a long time I thought about Marie. The days had been
long since she'd stopped writing. That evening I thought
about it and told myself that maybe she had gotten
tired of being the girlfriend of a condemned man. It also
occurred to me that maybe she was sick, or dead. These
things happen. How was I to know, since apart from our
two bodies, now separated, there wasn't anything to
keep us together or even to remind us of each other?
Anyway, after that, remembering Marie meant nothing
to me. I wasn't interested in her dead. That seemed
perfectly normal to me, since I understood very well
that people would forget me when I was dead. They
wouldn't have anything more to do with me . I wasn't
even able to tell myself that it was hard to think those
things.
