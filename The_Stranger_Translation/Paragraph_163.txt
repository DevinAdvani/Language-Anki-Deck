All day long there was the thought of my appeal. I
think I got everything out of it that I could. I would
assess my holdings and get the maximum return on my
thoughts. I would always begin by assuming the wors t :
m y appeal was denied. "Well, so I'm going to die."
Sooner than other people will, obviously. But everybody
knows life isn't worth living. Deep down I knew per
fectly well that it doesn't much matter whether you
die at thirty or at seventy, since in either case other
men and women will naturally go on living-and for
thousands of years. In fact, nothing could be clearer.
Whether it was now or twenty years from now, I would
still be the one dying. At that point, what would disturb
my train of thought was the terrifying leap I would feel
my heart take at the idea of having twenty more years of
life ahead of me. But I simply had to stifle it by im
agining what I'd be thinking in twenty years when it
would all come down to the same thing anyway. Since
we're all going to die, it's obvious that when and
how don't matter. Therefore (and the difficult thing
was not to lose sight of all the reasoning that went into
this "therefore") , I had to accept the rejection of my
appeal.
