The priest gazed around my cell and answered in a
voice that sounded very weary to me. "Every stone here
sweats with suffering, I know that. I have never looked
at them without a feeling of anguish. But deep in my
heart I know that the most wretched among you have
seen a divine face emerge from their darkness. That is
the face you are asked to see."
