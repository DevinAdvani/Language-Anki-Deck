He was expressing his certainty that my appeal would
be granted, but I was carrying the burden of a sin from
which I had to free myself. According to him, human
justice was nothing and divine justice was everything. I
pointed out that it was the former that had condemned
me. His response was that it hadn't washed away my sin
for all that. I told him I didn't know what a sin was.
All they had told me was that I was guilty. I was
guilty, I was paying for it, and nothing more could be
asked of me. At that point he stood up again, and the
thought occurred to me that in such a narrow cell, if
he wanted to move around he didn't have many options.
He could either sit down or stand up.
