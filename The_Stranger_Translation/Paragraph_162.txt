They always came at dawn, I knew that. 

And so I spent my nights waiting for that dawn. 

I've never liked being surprised. If something is going to happen to me, I want to be there. 

That's why I ended up sleeping only a little bit during the day and then, all night long, waited patiently for the first light to show on the pane of sky.

The hardest time was that uncertain hour when I knew they usually set to work. 

After midnight, I would wait and watch. 

My ears had never heard so many noises or picked up such small sounds. 

One thing I can say, though, is that in a certain way I was lucky that whole time, since I never heard footsteps. 

Maman used to say that you can always find something to be happy about.

In my prison, when the sky turned red and a new day slipped into my cell, I found out that she was right.

Because I might just as easily have heard footsteps and my heart could have burst. 

Even though I would rush to the door at the slightest shuffie, even though, with my ear pressed to the wood, I would wait frantically until I heard the sound of my own breathing, terrified to find it so hoarse, like a dog's panting, my heart would not burst after all, and I would have gained another twenty-four hours.
