He looked away and without moving asked me if I
wasn't talking that way out of extreme despair. I ex
plained to him that I wasn't desperate. I was just afraid,
which was only natural. "Then God can help you," he
said. "Every man I have known in your position has
turned to Him." I acknowledged that that was their right.
It also meant that they must have had the time for it. As
for me, I didn't want anybody's help, and I just didn't
have the time to interest myself in what didn't interest
me.
